You walk into a math classroom and find the following equations on the chalkboard:

nadokalol * mekalal = nadokalkalol
pekalol + mekalal = sakalal
namekalal + fanamekalol = mekalal
dokalkalol - namekalal = fanavodokalkalal
namekalal * dokalol = fanamekalol * pekalol
lokalal * mekalal = lokalkalal
pekalol + pekalol + mekalal - lokalal = rekalol
sakalkalal * pekalol = gokalkalkalol
dokalol = sakalal + mekalal
pekalol + pekalol - sakalal - mekalal = rekalol
lokalal - pekalol = sakalal
nadokalol * nalokalal = nafanavolokalkalkalol
namekalal + namekalal = fanamekalol
fanamekalol * mekalal = pekalol
zokalal + pekalol = sakalkalal

In addition, it appears that someone was counting in this system. They erased most of their writing; however, the following numbers were not erased, and are found in the following order with no lines in between them:

lokalal
nagokalol
fanagokalal
gokalol
nazokalal
fanazokalol
zokalal
